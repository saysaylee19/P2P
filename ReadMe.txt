Project Title: Peer-to-Peer system with Cntralised Index 				System.	

Project Description:

We have implemented a simple peer-to-peer  system with centralized index(CI) for the transfer of RFC's.
Our P2P-CI system, peers who wish to download an RFC that they do not have in their hard drive, may download it from another active peer who does. All communication among peers or between a peer and the server will take place over TCP.The centralized Server just maintains a list of the active peers and conveys that information to the peers.

Programming Language:
Python

Platform:
UNIX

Steps for Execution:
To start the Centralised Server:

python CentralServer.py

To start Peer1:

python PureThreadp1.py

(Enter the CentralServer Ip and Port)

To start Peer2:

python PureThreadp2.py

(Enter the CentralServer Ip and Port)

To start Peer3:

python PureThreadp3.py

(Enter the CentralServer Ip and Port)
